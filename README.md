# Workgroups for Windows (for Emacs)

Workgroups is a session management package for GNU Emacs.  It allows
you to store and restore window configurations (called "workgroups"
because it's shorter and funnier), save them to and load them from
disk, morph between them and perform various other operations on them.

Here's what the Elisp info docs have to say about window
configurations `(info "(Elisp)Window Configurations")`:

> A 'window configuration' records the entire layout of one frame--all
> windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain, how those buffers
> are scrolled, and their values of point and the mark; also their
> fringes, margins, and scroll bar settings.  It also includes the
> value of `minibuffer-scroll-window'.  As a special exception, the
> window configuration does not record the value of point in the
> selected window for the current buffer.  Also, the window
> configuration does not record the values of window parameters; see
> *Note Window Parameters::."

The problem with Emacs' window configurations is that they're opaque C
types: you can't peer inside them.  To get at the information in a
window configuration, you must restore it in a frame, then access that
frame's parameters.

Here's what the same info node has to say about window configuration
opacity:

> Other primitives to look inside of window configurations would make
> sense, but are not implemented because we did not need them."

Greeeeat.  Workgroups solves this problem by implementing an
independent window configuration object -- one that is translucent,
frobbable and serializable.  Workgroups' window configurations (called
"wconfigs") save all the settings listed above, and more.  For
instance, if a region is highlighted in `transient-mark-mode`, that
region will still be highlighted after restarting Emacs and restoring
that wconfig.  And wconfigs can be constructed programatically,
without the need to manipulate a live frame, vastly simplifying things
like frame morphing, window moving, frame reversing and other
operations.


## Getting Workgroups

The latest version of Workgroups can always be found
[here](http://github.com/tlh/workgroups.el). You can clone the repo by
running:

    git clone git://github.com/tlh/workgroups.el


## Installation

- Put `workgroups.el` somewhere on your Emacs load path

- Byte-compile `workgroups.el`.  This isn't required, but it'll speed
  some things up.  To do so, enter:

        M-x byte-compile-file RET /path/to/workgroups.el RET

- Add this line to your `.emacs` file:

        (require 'workgroups)


## Configuration

- Set your prefix key (or not).  The prefix key for Workgroups'
  commands defaults to `C-z`.  You could set it to `C-c w` like this:

        (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c w"))

  Workgroups saves the prefix key's current definition when it's
  enabled, and restores it when it's disabled, so you don't have to
  worry about stomping keydefs if you want to try out different
  prefixes.

- There are many other customization options.  See the customization
  section in the source for details, or use:

        M-x customize-group RET workgroups RET


## Usage

- Turn on `workgroups-mode` either by issuing the command:

        M-x workgroups-mode RET

  or by evaluating this form, which can be added to your `.emacs`
  file:

        (workgroups-mode 1)

  You should see "wg" in the minor mode list on the mode-line.

- To get started right away, hit `<prefix> ?` for a list of commands
  and their bindings.


## Tutorial

### Workgroup Creation

To start off, add a few workgroups.  Hit `<prefix> c` to issue the
command `wg-create-workgroup`, give it a name, hit `RET`, and a new
workgroup is created.  Maybe split the screen a few times with `C-x 2`
and `C-x 3`, and switch to different buffers in some of the windows to
make it unique.  Repeat this process a few times to create some
different workgroups.


### Workgroup Switching

`<prefix> v` issues the command `wg-switch-to-workgroup`.  This will
do a completing-read (with
[ido](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings) if it's
enabled) on the available workgroup names, and switch to the workgroup
with that name.  `<prefix> n` will switch to the workgroup rightward
in the workgroups list from the current workgroup, and `<prefix> p`
will switch to the one leftward in the list.  `<prefix> 0` through
`<prefix> 9` switch to the workgroup at that position in the
workgroups list.  Try switching between your workgroups now.


### Base and Working Configs

Window configs drift through use. Windows get resized; different
buffers get selected; point and mark change, and so on.  When you
switch from one workgroup to another, then back to the first, you want
it to be in the same state that you left it in so you don't lose your
place.  At the same time, it can be tedious getting the window
configuration just the way one likes it, and it sucks when it gets
irrevocably mangled.  So it'd be nice to be able to revert it back to
a known-good state at any time.  For this reason, every workgroup
actually consists of two wconfigs: a base config and a working config
[1].  The base config is the pristine original wconfig.  It only gets
altered explicitly, and you can revert back to it at any time.  And
the working config is whatever the frame happens to look like while
you're using it [2].  You set the base config to the working config
with `<prefix> u` (`wg-update-workgroup`), and you set the working
config to the base config with `<prefix> r` (`wg-revert-workgroup`).
The two commands are mirror images of each other: the former sets the
base to the working, and the latter sets the working to the base.  You
can update all workgroups' base configs to their working configs with
`<prefix> U` (`wg-update-all-workgroups`), and you can revert all
workgroups' working configs to their base configs with `<prefix> R`
(`wg-revert-all-workgroups`).  Update all your workgroups with
`<prefix> U` now.

[1] That's not entirely true: working configs are actually properties
of frames, so every frame has its own working config for each
workgroup.  This is because when working with multiple frames, one
expects the working config for that frame to remain the same.  If you
move to another frame and modify a workgroup's working config, then
switch back to the first frame, it doesn't feel right when the working
config has changed while you were gone.  This may seem complicated,
but in practice it's very natural.  There's only one base config per
workgroup, though, so they're the same across all frames.

[2] Workgroups tracks working configs lazily: it doesn't update the
working config every time changes are made to the frame -- only when
the working config is requested by a function.  This produces the same
behavior, but much simpler code.


### Saving and Loading

Saving and loading was the original motivation for writing Workgroups.
You can save your workgroups to a file with `<prefix> C-s` (`wg-save`)
and you can load workgroups from a file with `<prefix> C-l`
(`wg-load`).  Save your workgroups now.

Once you have a file of saved workgroups, it's convenient to load
it on Emacs startup.  To do so you can add a line like this to
your `.emacs`:

    (wg-load "/path/to/saved/workgroups")

So your final `.emacs` setup may look something like this:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/workgroups.el")
    (require 'workgroups)
    (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c a"))
    (workgroups-mode 1)
    (wg-load "/path/to/saved/workgroups")

The customization variable `wg-switch-on-load` controls whether to
automatically switch to the first workgroup in a file when the file is
loaded.  It defaults to `t`, so when you add the above to your
`.emacs` file, the first workgroup in the file will automatically be
switched to on Emacs startup.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why is it called "Workgroups"?

**A:** Mostly because it's funny, but it also makes sense.  I needed a
  name that would also work for the window configuration objects being
  manipulated.  Elscreen has "screens", which works well.  I couldn't
  call them "window configurations" because it's too long, and Emacs
  already uses that for something else.  It'd be misleading, too,
  since a workgroup is actually a named set of multiple wconfigs (one
  base config, and then a working config for each frame).  So
  "Workgroups" it is.  I'll have to do something special for the 3.11
  release.

**Q:** Why should I use Workgroups instead of Elscreen?

**A:** Workgroups provides persistence, base/working configs,
  frame-morphing and other chrome, and cleaner code.  And it's
  maintained.

**Q:** What's the difference between a "window configuration", a
  "wconfig" and a "workgroup"?

**A:** A "window configuration" is Emacs' opaque internal
  representation of frame state.  A "wconfig" is Workgroups' own
  independent window configuration type.  And a "workgroup" is a named
  set of multiple wconfigs (one base config, and then a working config
  for each frame).


## A Note On Application Buffers

Workgroups doesn't currently save the state of applications like ERC
or Gnus, though this is on the TODO list.  If you save a workgroup
that includes application buffers, and then you restore that workgroup
in another Emacs session before relaunching those applications and
buffers, Workgroups will just default to `*scratch*`.  To get back to
your saved state, launch those applications and buffers and hit
`<prefix> R` to `wg-revert-all-workgroups`.
