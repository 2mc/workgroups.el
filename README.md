# workgroups.el - workgroups for windows

## Commentary

workgroups.el is a simple window configuration persistence package.
It saves the window layout of the current frame, and, if a window's
buffer is visiting a file, it saves the filename as well.  And that's
it. It doesn't try to save complicated information about the buffer,
like major or minor modes. If you save configurations that include
things like erc or gnus buffers, you should launch those applications
and buffers again in your next session before restoring the
configuration that includes them. Nothing bad will happen otherwise,
of course -- workgroups will just default to a buffer that already
exist.
