;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  workgroups.el is a session management package for GNU Emacs.
;;  It allows you to store and restore window configurations, save
;;  them to a file, load them from a file, and perform various other
;;  operations on them.
;;
;;  Here's what the Elisp info docs have to say about window
;;  configurations (info "(Elisp)Window Configurations"):
;;
;;     "A 'window configuration' records the entire layout of one
;;      frame--all windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain,
;;      how those buffers are scrolled, and their values of point and
;;      the mark; also their fringes, margins, and scroll bar
;;      settings.  It also includes the value of
;;      `minibuffer-scroll-window'.  As a special exception, the
;;      window configuration does not record the value of point in the
;;      selected window for the current buffer.  Also, the window
;;      configuration does not record the values of window parameters;
;;      see *Note Window Parameters::."
;;
;;  The problem with Emacs' window-configurations is that they're
;;  opaque: you can't peer inside them.  To get at the information in
;;  a window-configuration, you must restore it in a frame, then
;;  access that frame's parameters.
;;
;;  Here's what the same info node has to say about
;;  window-configuration opacity:
;;
;;     "Other primitives to look inside of window configurations would
;;      make sense, but are not implemented because we did not need
;;      them."
;;
;;  Greeeeat.  Workgroups solves this problem by implementing a
;;  completely independent window-configuration system -- one that is
;;  translucent, frobbable and serializable.  Workgroups window
;;  configurations save all the settings listed above, and more.  For
;;  instance, if a region is highlighted in transient-mark-mode, and
;;  you then save a workgroup, that region will still be highlighted
;;  after restarting Emacs.  And workgroups can be constructed on the
;;  fly, without the need to first restore them in a frame, allowing
;;  things like frame morphing and other manipulations.
;;
;;  Workgroups tracks window configurations lazily: it doesn't update
;;  the current config every time changes are made to the frame --
;;  only when the current config is requested by a function.
;;
;;  If you save workgroups that include things like erc or gnus
;;  buffers, you should launch those applications and buffers again in
;;  your next session before restoring the workgroup that includes
;;  them. Nothing bad will happen otherwise, of course.  workgroups
;;  will just default to a buffer that already exists, like *scratch*.
;;
;;  `workgroups-list' contains all the currently available workgroups.
;;  You can switch to workgroups (i.e. restore window configurations),
;;  bury them, go to the previous or next workgroup circularly, etc.
;;  `workgroups-save' saves `workgroups-list' to a file, which can
;;  then be loaded in another session.  Workgroups are added to
;;  `workgroups-list' by calling `workgroups-create', removed by
;;  calling `workgroups-kill', and can be moved to the end of
;;  `workgroups-list' by calling `workgroups-bury'.  In general,
;;  operations on workgroups and `workgroups-list' behave as similarly
;;  to buffers and buffer-lists as possible.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;   - Put `workgroups.el' somewhere on your emacs load path
;;
;;   - M-x byte-compile-file RET <path-to-workgroups.el> RET
;;     This isn't required, but it'll speed things up.
;;
;;   - Add this line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'workgroups)
;;
;;   - The prefix key for workgroups commands defaults to "C-z", which
;;     elscreen users may be used to.  You could set it to "C-c a"
;;     like this:
;;
;;     (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c a"))
;;
;;     workgroups saves the current key definition when it's enabled,
;;     and restores it when it's disabled, so you don't have to worry
;;     about stomping keydefs if you want to try different ones out.
;;
;;   - There are many other customizable options.  See the
;;     customization section in the source for details, or use:
;;
;;     C-u M-x customize-mode RET workgroups RET
;;

;;; Usage:
;;
;;   Once you have it installed, turn it on either by issuing the
;;   command:
;;
;;     M-x workgroups RET
;;
;;   or by evaluating this form, which you can put in .emacs:
;;
;;     (workgroups 1)
;;
;;   You can turn it off again by issuing the same command, or by
;;   evaluating this form:
;;
;;     (workgroups 0)
;;
;;   From here on out, all keys are listed with "C-z" as the prefix,
;;   like "C-z c".  You should substitute your prefix key for "C-z" if
;;   you've changed it.
;;
;;
;;; Workgroup Creation:
;;
;;   To start off, add a few workgroups.  Hit "C-z c" to issue the
;;   command `wg-create-workgroup', enter a name, and a new blank
;;   workgroup is created.  Maybe split the screen a few times with
;;   "C-x 2" and "C-x 3", and switch to different buffers in some of
;;   the windows to make it unique.  Repeat this a few times to create
;;   some different workgroups.
;;
;;
;;; Workgroup Switching:
;;
;;   "C-z v" issues the command `wg-switch-to-workgroup'.  This will
;;   do a completing-read (with ido if it's available) on the
;;   available workgroup names, and switch to the workgroup with that
;;   name.  "C-z C-n" will switch to workgroup rightward in the
;;   workgroups list from the current workgroup, and "C-z C-p" will
;;   switch to the one leftward.  "C-z 0" through "C-z 9" switch to
;;   the workgroup at index in the workgroups list.
;;
;;
;;; Base and Working Configs:
;;
;;   Window configs drift through use. Windows get resized, different
;;   buffers get selected, point and mark change, and so on.  When you
;;   switch from one workgroup to another, then back to the first, you
;;   want it to be in the same state that you left it in, so you don't
;;   lose your place.  At the same time, it's convenient to be able to
;;   revert a window config to a base state when it gets hoplessly
;;   mangled.  For this reason, every workgroup actually consists of
;;   two configs: a base config and a working config [1].  The base
;;   config is the pristine config you'd like to be able to revert
;;   back to, and the working config is whatever the frame happens to
;;   look like now.  You set the base config to the working config
;;   with "C-z u" -- `wg-update-workgroup', and you set the working
;;   config to the base config with "C-z r" -- `wg-revert-workgroup'.
;;   So the two commands are mirror images of each other: the former
;;   sets the base to the working, and the latter sets the working to
;;   the base.  You can update all workgroups' base configs with their
;;   working configs with "C-z U" -- `wg-update-all-workgroups', and
;;   you can revert all workgroups' working configs to their base
;;   configs with "C-z R" -- `wg-revert-all-workgroups'.  Update all
;;   your workgroups with "C-z U" now.
;;
;;   [1] That's not entirely true: Working configs are actually
;;   properties of frames.  Every frame has its own working config for
;;   each base config.  This is because when working with multiple
;;   frames, one expects the working config for that frame to remain
;;   the same -- not to change when it's changed in another frame.
;;   This may seem a little complicated, but in practice it's very
;;   natural.  Base configs are the same across all frames, though.
;;
;;
;;; Saving and Loading:
;;
;;   You can save all your workgroups to a file with "C-z C-s" --
;;   `wg-save', and you can load a workgroups file with "C-z C-l" --
;;   `wg-load'.  Save your workgroups to a file now.
;;
;;   Once you have a file of saved workgroups, it's convenient to load
;;   it on Emacs startup.  To do so you can add a line like this to
;;   your .emacs:
;;
;;     (wg-load "/path/to/saved/workgroups")
;;
;;   So the final setup in your .emacs may look something like this:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/workgroups.el")
;;     (require 'workgroups)
;;     (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c a"))
;;     (workgroups 1)
;;     (wg-load "/path/to/saved/workgroups")
