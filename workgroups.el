;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    workgroups.el is a simple window configuration persistence
;;    package.  It saves the window layout of the current frame, and,
;;    if a window's buffer is visiting a file, it saves the filename
;;    as well.  And that's it. It doesn't try to save complicated
;;    information about the buffer, like major or minor modes. If you
;;    save configurations that include things like erc or gnus
;;    buffers, you should launch those applications and buffers again
;;    in your next session before restoring the configuration that
;;    includes them. Nothing bad will happen otherwise, of course --
;;    workgroups will just default to a buffer that already exists.
;;

;;; Features:
;;
;;  - Saving window configurations
;;
;;  - Restoring window configurations
;;
;;  - Persisting window configurations across sessions
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  - Put `workgroups.el' somewhere on your emacs load path
;;
;;  - Add this line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;    (require 'workgroups)
;;

;;; Configuration:
;;
;;  - to change the file that configs are saved in:
;;    (setq workgroups-configs-file "/path/to/new/file")
;;
;;  - workgroups-restore-hook is a hook that's run whenever a
;;    workgroup is restored. You can add functions to it like this:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'workgroups-restore-hook 'foo)
;;

;;; Some sample keybindings:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-a") 'workgroups-add-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-r") 'workgroups-restore-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-d") 'workgroups-delete-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-u") 'workgroups-update-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-v") 'workgroups-revert-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-s ,")       'workgroups-prev-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-s .")       'workgroups-next-config)
;;

;;; Or if you use ido-mode:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-a") 'workgroups-ido-add-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-r") 'workgroups-ido-restore-config)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g C-d") 'workgroups-ido-delete-config)
;;
