;;; Commentary:
;;
;; workgroups.el is a simple window configuration persistence package.
;;

;;; Features:
;;
;;  - Saving window configurations
;;
;;  - Restoring window configurations
;;
;;  - Persisting window configurations across sessions
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  - put `workgroups.el' somewhere on your emacs load path
;;
;;  - add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;    (require 'workgroups)
;;    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'workgroups-load-configs)
;;

;;; Configuration:
;;
;;  - to change the file that window-configs are saved in:
;;    (setq workgroups-configs-file "/path/to/new/file")
;;
;;  - workgroups-restore-hook is a hook that's run whenever a
;;    workgroup is restored. You can add functions to it like this:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'workgroups-restore-hook 'foo)
;;

;;; Some sample keybindings:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g a") 'workgroups-add-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g r") 'workgroups-restore-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g d") 'workgroups-delete-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g u") 'workgroups-update-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g p") 'workgroups-prev-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g n") 'workgroups-next-config)
;;

;;; And if you use ido-mode:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g A") 'workgroups-ido-add-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g R") 'workgroups-ido-restore-config)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g D") 'workgroups-ido-delete-config)
;;
