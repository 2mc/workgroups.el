effectively invisible to undoification.  Workgroups solves this

a single hash-table lookup per command, there's no noticeable

  '((all "all" wg-buffer-list-filter-all)

    (unassociated "unassociated" wg-buffer-list-filter-unassociated)
    (fallback "fallback" nil))
  "List of buffer-list-filter definitions.
Each entry should be a list containing an identifier symbol, a
prompt string, and a function form that's funcall'd to produce
the filtered buffer-list.

The prompt string is displayed in the minibuffer-prompt when its
filter is active.

The function form should be either a function-symbol or a lambda, and
should take two arguments: a workgroup and an initial
buffer-list.  The workgroup may be any workgroup identifier
accepted by `wg-get-workgroup-flexibly', and the initial
buffer-list is a list of live Emacs buffers and/or the names of
live Emacs buffers.  The function should return the filtered list
of buffer objects and/or buffer names.  You may not need these
arguments in your custom filters, but they're necessary for some
of the built-in filters.

Default buffer-list-filters include:

`all'           All buffer names

`associated'    Only the names of those live buffers that have
                been associated with the current workgroup

`unassociated'  Only the names of those live buffers that are
                unassociated with the current workgroup

`fallback'      A special case used to fallback to the
                original (non-ido/iswitchb) Emacs command.
                `fallback' isn't actually a buffer-list-filter
                itself, but can be used in
                `wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist' just the
                same.

A few example custom buffer-list filtration functions are
included, like `wg-buffer-list-filter-home-dir',
`wg-buffer-list-filter-irc' and `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp'.
See their definitions for more info on how they're defined, and
the utilities they're built on.

Here's an example of how to add an `elisp' buffer-list-filter
definition to `wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions' using the
example function `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp':

(add-to-list
 'wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions
 '(elisp \"elisp\" wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp))

After this form has been evaluated, `elisp' can be used wherever
other buffer-list-filter identifiers are used, like in
`wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist'."

Buffers can be auto-associated with workgroups whenever they are
made visible in windows (by any function that bottoms out in a
call to `switch-to-buffer' or `set-window-buffer').  This setting
determines whether and how that happens.  The workgroup with
which to associate the buffer is the current workgroup in the
window's frame.

`no-assoc' means don't associate buffers with workgroups.
`soft' means soft-associate buffers with workgroups.
`hard' means hard-associate buffers with workgroups.

If the value is a function specifier (a function-symbol or a lambda),
it will be `funcall'd to determine whether and how to associate
the buffer.  The function should accept two arguments -- a
workgroup and a buffer -- and should return one of the above
values.

Any other value means don't associate buffers with workgroups.

Also, if the workgroup's `buffer-auto-association' parameter is
non-nil, it overrides this setting.  Allowable values of the

;;
;; window-point is a property of a buffer/window pair, but won't set properly
;; unless the buffer is current -- i.e. (set-window-buffer some-window
;; some-buffer) (set-window-point some-window 0)) won't set some-buffer's point
;; in some-window unless some-buffer is also current.
;;
;; window-start and window-hscroll are properties of buffer/window pairs.
