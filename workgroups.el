window-configuration changes -- like changes to selected-window,
window scrolling, point, mark, fringes, margins and scroll-bars

effectively invisible to undoification.  Workgroups solves this
problem by checking in `pre-command-hook' whether `this-command'
is in this table, and saving undo info if it is.  Since it's just
a single hash-table lookup per command, there's no noticeable
slowdown.  Add commands to this table if they aren't already
present, and you want up-to-date undo info saved prior to their

;; buffer-list filtration customization

(defcustom wg-buffer-list-filtration-on t
  "Non-nil means Workgroups' buffer-list filtration feature is on.
Nil means ido and iswitchb behave normally.  See
`wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions' for more info."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'workgroups)

(defcustom wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions
  '((all "all" wg-buffer-list-filter-all)
    (associated "associated" wg-buffer-list-filter-associated)
    (unassociated "unassociated" wg-buffer-list-filter-unassociated)
    (fallback "fallback" nil))
  "List of buffer-list-filter definitions.
Each entry should be a list containing an identifier symbol, a
prompt string, and a function form that's funcall'd to produce
the filtered buffer-list.

The prompt string is displayed in the minibuffer-prompt when its
filter is active.

The function form should be either a function-symbol or a lambda, and
should take two arguments: a workgroup and an initial
buffer-list.  The workgroup may be any workgroup identifier
accepted by `wg-get-workgroup-flexibly', and the initial
buffer-list is a list of live Emacs buffers and/or the names of
live Emacs buffers.  The function should return the filtered list
of buffer objects and/or buffer names.  You may not need these
arguments in your custom filters, but they're just necessary for
some of the built-in filters.

Default buffer-list-filters include:

`all'           All buffer names

`associated'    Only the names of those live buffers that have
                been associated with the current workgroup

`unassociated'  Only the names of those live buffers that are
                unassociated with the current workgroup

`fallback'      A special case used to fallback to the
                original (non-ido/iswitchb) Emacs command.
                `fallback' isn't actually a buffer-list-filter
                itself, but can be used in
                `wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist' just the
                same.

A few example custom buffer-list filtration functions are
included, like `wg-buffer-list-filter-home-dir',
`wg-buffer-list-filter-irc' and `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp'.
See their definitions for more info on how they're defined, and
the utilities they're built on.

Here's an example of how to add an `elisp' buffer-list-filter
definition to `wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions' using the
example function `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp':

(add-to-list
 'wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions
 '(elisp \"elisp\" wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp))

After this form has been evaluated, `elisp' can be used wherever
other buffer-list-filter identifiers are used, like in
`wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist'."
